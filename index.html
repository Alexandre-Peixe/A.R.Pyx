          <h3>1934: Caught in the Crossroads</h3>
          <p class="book-genre">Historical Thriller · Adventure · Archaeological Mystery</p>
          <p>
          1934, Ljubljana. A quiet museum presentation explodes into chaos when Nazi operatives steal a 17th-century Ottoman ledger. 
            The document reveals a "Hattin Treasure" among the possessions of the Ottoman vizier during the 1683 Siege of Vienna. It 
            can only refer to a large piece of the True Cross, lost during the Crusades. What power it actually holds—political, 
            religious, symbolic—no one knows for sure. But enough people want it badly enough to kill. Fitzwilliam van Tandig, a Great 
            War veteran turned security manager, sent to represent the construction company that unearthed the artifacts. Lieselotte 
            Bauer, a German scholar driven from academia by the Nazi purge, now working for the resistance. Milan Novak, an archaeologist 
            about to realize his discovery is far more dangerous than he knew. And Elizabeth, Fitz's sister, who never misses a dramatic 
            opportunity—and whose theatrical training proves unexpectedly useful. Thrown together by circumstance, they become the only 
            people standing between the Nazis and a quest nearly eight centuries old.
            </p> <p>
            The trail winds from Osijek to Vienna to Bucharest—from Ottoman records to flooded tunnels beneath a monastery island. The clues 
            are carved in stone, hidden and encoded in the very layout of ancient buildings.
            </p> <p>
            This is not a story about a lone hero stopping evil. These are ordinary people who didn't volunteer for this and won't walk away 
            unchanged. Their success depends on cooperation, local knowledge, and trust. The very values authoritarianism seeks to destroy. 
            It's about how the past gets weaponized, and what it takes to reclaim it.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p class="novella-title-display"><em>Hic Non Sunt Dracones</em></p>
          <p class="novella-tagline">1897. A fading learned society. A legendary major with one last gambit.
            And a young writer who really didn't sign up for this.</p>
          <p>It's my homage to the adventure novels I wore out as a child: Haggard, Verne, Doyle, Kipling. 
            The ones where men with excellent mustaches marched into unmapped territory and came back with 
            stories that made London lean forward in its chair. I love those books. But I also wanted to write
            something that carried their pleasures—the crackling dialogue, the larger-than-life characters, 
            the sense that the world still holds secrets, but giving it a modern readability.</p> 
          <p>The novella follows Major Jason Havelock, who may or may not be a living legend; his ragtag crew of misfits;
            and a young writer who discovers that volunteering for an expedition sounds much safer in a book than in the 
            real world. Their destination: a lost city in the Brazilian wilderness, first glimpsed in a 1753 manuscript 
            and never seen since. Their complication: the city entrance lies at the heart of the Canudos rebellion, and 
            the army is on its way to level the place.</p>
          <p>What happens next resists easy telling. Accounts contradict. Memories fail. Sixty years later, the narrator is 
            still not sure. Neither am I. That's the point.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Not a prequel. Not a sequel. Just a story.</strong> 
    My own take on classical adventure, and an invitation to think about what comes next.</p>

          <h3>A.R.Pyx</h3>
          <p>
            I write historical fiction for people who want their adventures grounded, 
            their characters complicated, and their research invisible—until you start 
            wondering what's real and start looking things up at 2 AM.
            </p> <p>
            I'm fascinated by periods of transition: the 1890s and the 1930s—moments 
            when old certainties crumble and ordinary people have to figure out what comes 
            next. The people who lived through them weren't heroes in the storybook sense. 
            They were just trying to get by, to protect what mattered, to answer a question 
            that wouldn't let go.
            </p> <p>
            I've worked in a range of roles that taught me how stories get told in different 
            contexts. I now collaborate with archaeology departments, a background that 
            sharpened my curiosity about how we represent the past in narrative. What gets 
            included? What gets left out? And who gets to decide?
          <em>1934: Caught in the Crossroads</em> is my first novel. It blurs the line where 
            official record ends and fictional story begins. It stands completely alone, but 
            it's also the first in a planned series—rooted in real places, real events, and the 
            kind of characters who refuse to stay on the sidelines.

      <h2>On Adventure</h2>
      <p class="newsletter-subtitle">A monthly letter about the roads less traveled.</p>
      <p>
        History, hidden places, and the stories behind the stories.
        No algorithms — just a letter from one curious mind to another.
        A monthly letter about history, discovery, and the stories we tell
        <p>
        It's called On Adventure. It's not a sales pitch. It's a place to think out loud about:
          The evolution of adventure stories—from Victorian explorers to modern archaeological thrillers
          How discovery persists in a world without obvious "blank spaces"
          The relationship between history, fiction, and myth
          What the 1890s and 1930s can tell us about our own moment of transition
          Each issue is essayistic, reflective, and (I hope) lightly humorous. It arrives once a month, 
          predictably, and then goes quiet until the next one. No pressure. Just ideas.
